- This is a fork of Primeagen's repository `kata-machine` used in his Frontend 
Master course (The Last Algorithms Course You'll Need). Please check `README.md`
in the original fork.
- This repository will include other things I did relative to data structure 
and algorithms, and problem solving topic (Leetcode, Advent of Code).
- This repository is under migration from [whetstone](https://github.com/Dekr0/whetstone) 
where I stored all my solution for Leetcode problem written in different solution.
